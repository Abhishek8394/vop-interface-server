# vop-interface-server
Interface used by ([Project VoiceEngine] (https://github.com/Abhishek8394/VoiceEngine/tree/master)) to talk with desktop applications. Works as a simple bridge
for transferring commands between Voice Engine and any desktop application.

## Status
Currently supports web sockets (getting [Project firefox-voice-extension] (https://github.com/Abhishek8394/firefox-voice-extension) is a priority).
Just a basic skeleton for now, needs more changes.
